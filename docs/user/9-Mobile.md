# Mobile App

Companion App
- Streams locations to your own server and supports offline maps via tile caching.
- Build from source or install a package from your operator.

Connect to Your Server
1) Open Settings. Optionally use the QR scanner to prefill Server URL and API Token.
2) Set your Server URL (domain/IP for your instance).
3) In the web app, create an API token under your account; paste or scan into the mobile app.
4) Test — the app fetches server settings and activity types.

Tracking
- Toggle Timeline Tracking. When off, GPS may run for navigation but no timeline logs are uploaded.
- Manual Check‑In records a point on demand (rate‑limited to prevent spam).

Groups
- Join via invitations. View members and subscribe to live updates.

Offline Maps
- Download tiles for selected trips. Configure cache size and prefetch radius in Settings.
- You can change the tile server URL (respect usage policies).

Privacy
- You control your data and server URL. Rotate tokens if exposed.
