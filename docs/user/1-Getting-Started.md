# Getting Started

This page helps you sign in, learn the layout, and understand the core concepts. Wayfarer is self-hosted; your administrator (which may be you) controls server address, user accounts, and data retention. No single global domain exists.

Access and Accounts
- Sign In: Use the server URL provided for your installation.
- Accounts: Your admin manages registration settings. If registration is closed, request an invite.
- Passwords: Your admin sets initial credentials. Change them after first login under your account settings. Do not share credentials. Two‑factor authentication (2FA) is supported via the account management pages.

App Layout
- Top Navigation: Switch between Dashboard, Trips, Timeline, Groups, and Admin (if you have access).
- Left/Right Panels: Context menus (filters, import, settings) depending on the page.
- Map: Interactive map (Leaflet) with OpenStreetMap tiles (optionally cached locally for performance).

Core Concepts
- Timeline: Your personal location points over time (ingested from device logs or imports).
- Trips: Structured plans composed of Regions, Places, Areas (polygons), and Segments (routes) with notes.
- Groups: Share live or recently uploaded locations with trusted members. Owners manage membership and visibility.

First Steps
1) Review account profile and change your password.
2) Explore Timeline or Trips from the menu.
3) If you have historical data, see Importing Data to upload GPX/KML/CSV/GeoJSON/Google exports.
4) Optional: Install and connect the companion mobile app for live location updates.
5) If you’ll self‑host, see “Install & Self‑Hosting” next.
