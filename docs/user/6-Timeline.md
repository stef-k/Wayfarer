# Timeline (Public/Private, Hidden Areas, Embed)

Private vs Public
- Your timeline is private by default. You can make it public to share on the web.
- When public, visitors can view your timeline via a public URL. You can set a time threshold (e.g., hide the most recent hours/days).

Hidden Areas
- You can draw Hidden Areas so locations inside them never appear on your public timeline.
- Manage from: User > Hidden Areas. Create, edit, or delete polygons that hide sensitive places.

Embed Your Public Timeline
- Use the embed URL to include your public timeline in another site:
- Example: `<iframe src="https://<your-server>/Public/Users/Timeline/<username>/embed" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>`
- Replace `<your-server>` and `<username>` with your instance and username.

Stats
- Public endpoints also provide aggregated stats for your username to support simple “about me” blocks.

Bulk Edit Notes
- From Locations > Bulk Edit Notes, you can search by filters and update notes for many records at once.
