# Groups

What Are Groups?
- Groups let trusted members share live or recent locations. Each group has an owner who manages membership and settings.

Joining a Group
- Joining is by invitation from a group owner/manager. Accept or decline invitations from the app.

Creating a Group
1) Open Groups and click Create.
2) Name the group and save.
3) Invite members using usernames or emails as available.

Visibility and Privacy
- Group data is shared only among members. Owners can remove members.
- Optional organizational peer‑visibility settings may be available.

Best Practices
- Invite only trusted people. Rotate API tokens regularly when used with mobile clients.
