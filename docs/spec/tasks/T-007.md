## Summary
Enrich location SSE broadcasts with additional metadata and introduce a group-level SSE channel so mobile clients can subscribe once per group without breaking existing web listeners.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [x] Location ingestion broadcasts include `{ userId, userName, locationId, timestampUtc, isLive }` while maintaining backward-compatible payload fields for web.
- [x] Group-level channel `group-location-update-{groupId}` broadcasts for members and returns 401/403 when the caller lacks access.
- [x] Automated tests verify enriched payload shape, continued compatibility with web SSE consumers, and group-channel delivery.

## Steps
- [x] Read inputs
- [x] Implement payload enrichment and group-level broadcasting
- [x] Add/adjust tests
- [x] Run verification
- [x] Update spec/index.yml (status, deps if changed)

## Verification
- `dotnet test --filter LocationSseBroadcasts`
- Manual: trigger location update and confirm both per-user and group channel events

## Notes
Consider feature flag if enrichment/group channel needs staged rollout; document payload changes for clients.
