## Summary
Add Manager views and JS to manage group roster and invitations: list members, invite users/managers, and reflect pending/active statuses.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [x] Areas/Manager/Views/Groups/Members.cshtml renders roster and invite UI.
- [x] wwwroot/js/Areas/Manager/Groups/members.js calls APIs to invite/remove.
- [x] Accept/decline reflected after API calls; UI updates without full reload.

## Steps
- [x] Read inputs
- [x] Add Razor view and JS module
- [x] Integrate invitations and member removal APIs
- [x] Handle success/error alerts using BaseController helpers
- [x] Update spec/index.yml

## Verification
- dotnet run → /Manager/Groups/Members?groupId=...
- Invite a user; accept/decline from other account; roster updates

## Notes
Follow existing alert patterns (SetAlert) for UX feedback.
