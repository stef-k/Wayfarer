## Summary
Implement API for listing, creating, and acting on invitations (accept/decline) for both managers and users per design.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [x] List pending invitations for current user returns correct data.
- [x] Accept/decline updates invitation status and membership accordingly.
- [x] All actions enforce membership/admin rules and return correct status codes.

## Steps
- [x] Read inputs
- [x] Add controller actions and DTOs
- [x] Wire to invitation service methods
- [x] Add basic integration tests (happy + sad paths)
- [x] Update spec/index.yml

## Verification
- curl /api/invitations (auth as user/manager) returns pending list
- curl -X POST /api/invitations/{id}/accept returns 200 and adds member
- curl -X POST /api/invitations/{id}/decline returns 200 and marks declined

## Notes
Respect auditing for invite/accept/decline via BaseController.LogAudit.
