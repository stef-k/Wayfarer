## Summary
Expose GET /api/groups/{groupId}/members returning user roster with role/status details, respecting group membership authorization.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [x] Endpoint returns only for authorized members; non-members receive 403.
- [x] Response includes { userId, username, displayName, groupRole, status }.
- [x] Pagination or server limits documented if needed.

## Steps
- [x] Read inputs
- [x] Implement controller action and DTO mapping
- [x] Add auth checks for membership
- [x] Add integration test for member vs non-member
- [x] Update spec/index.yml

## Verification
- curl /api/groups/{groupId}/members (as member) returns expected schema
- curl /api/groups/{groupId}/members (as non-member) returns 403

## Notes
Reuse existing Identity/User lookups for username/displayName.
