## Summary
Create Manager area views and JS for listing/creating/editing groups with validation, aligned with existing Bootstrap and area patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Areas/Manager/Views/Groups/Index.cshtml shows managed groups; Create/Edit forms work.
- [ ] wwwroot/js/Areas/Manager/Groups/index.js handles CRUD UX and client-side validation.
- [ ] Server returns/accepts expected data; navigation integrates with site layout.

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Add Razor views and minimal controllers if needed
- [ ] Implement JS module for forms and actions
- [ ] Wire to API endpoints
- [ ] Update spec/index.yml

## Verification
- dotnet run and navigate to /Manager/Groups
- Create group of each type; confirm appears in list

## Notes
Match style and scripts structure from existing Public area patterns.
