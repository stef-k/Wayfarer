## Summary
Document the mobile group APIs, SSE usage, configuration knobs, and operational guidance so deployment teams can enable the mobile feature safely.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [x] Docs (README/API reference/design appendix) describe endpoints, auth requirements, pagination limits, SSE heartbeats, and group channel usage.
- [x] Ops notes cover configuration (heartbeat interval, pagination caps), monitoring, and rollout steps.
- [x] Documentation lint/check commands (if any) pass.

## Steps
- [x] Read inputs
- [x] Update relevant documentation
- [x] Run verification
- [x] Update spec/index.yml (status, deps if changed)

## Verification
- `markdownlint docs/**/*.md` (or equivalent)

## Notes
Include curl examples and highlight differences between web vs mobile flows; capture any feature flag/telemetry considerations.
