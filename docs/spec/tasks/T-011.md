## Summary
Document the mobile group APIs, SSE usage, configuration knobs, and operational guidance so deployment teams can enable the mobile feature safely.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Docs (README/API reference/design appendix) describe endpoints, auth requirements, pagination limits, SSE heartbeats, and group channel usage.
- [ ] Ops notes cover configuration (heartbeat interval, pagination caps), monitoring, and rollout steps.
- [ ] Documentation lint/check commands (if any) pass.

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Update relevant documentation
- [ ] Run verification
- [ ] Update spec/index.yml (status, deps if changed)

## Verification
- `markdownlint docs/**/*.md` (or equivalent)

## Notes
Include curl examples and highlight differences between web vs mobile flows; capture any feature flag/telemetry considerations.
