## Summary
Add internal API endpoints for creating/listing groups (managed/joined), leaving groups, and removing members with proper authorization and auditing.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Endpoints exist and match design routes; unauthorized access returns 403.
- [ ] Group creation sets IsAdmin for creator as described.
- [ ] Leave/remove flows update member status and audit entries are logged.

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Implement controller actions and route attributes
- [ ] Wire to services and policy checks
- [ ] Add minimal integration tests (if feasible)
- [ ] Update spec/index.yml

## Verification
- curl -X POST /api/groups -d '{"name":"Acme","type":"Organisation"}'
- curl /api/groups?scope=managed and /api/groups?scope=joined return expected lists
- curl -X POST /api/groups/{groupId}/members/{userId}/remove returns 200 and updates state

## Notes
Controllers should live under Areas/Api; reuse base controller patterns.
