## Summary
Implement optional pruning of empty groups when the last member leaves, controlled via Group.IsAutoDeleteWhenEmpty or global setting.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Leaving/removal checks for last active member and deletes when enabled.
- [ ] Deletion cascades/constraints are safe; audit is recorded.
- [ ] Feature can be toggled off; when off, groups remain after last member leaves.

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Add conditional deletion in leave/remove flows
- [ ] Ensure FK constraints or soft-delete patterns are respected
- [ ] Add unit test(s) for both enabled/disabled modes
- [ ] Update spec/index.yml

## Verification
- dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AutoDeleteEmptyGroups"
- Manual: remove last member and confirm group deletion when enabled

## Notes
Consider background cleanup if immediate deletion is disabled (future work).
