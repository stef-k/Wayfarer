## Summary
Verify all actions (invite, accept, decline, remove, leave, settings changes) produce audit logs via BaseController.LogAudit and document the audit events.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [x] Each action path logs an audit entry with actor, target, group, and outcome.
- [x] Documentation page lists events and fields captured.
- [x] Manual verification steps demonstrate logs appearing in configured sink.

## Steps
- [x] Read inputs
- [x] Review and add missing LogAudit calls
- [x] Add concise docs in developer README or area-specific docs
- [x] Create a manual verification script/guide
- [x] Update spec/index.yml

## Verification
- Exercise: create/invite/accept/remove/leave/toggle settings; inspect logs at `Logging:LogFilePath:Default`
- grep/rg for audit markers confirms entries with expected context

## Notes
Keep PII minimal; follow security/privacy policy.
