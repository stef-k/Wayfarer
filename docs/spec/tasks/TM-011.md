## Summary
Create User area invitations list allowing accept/decline with immediate feedback and state refresh. Ensure future map/timeline pages follow the same logic as Manager: a) live (threshold), b) last (latest), c) rest. Provide sidebar for user/group selection where applicable.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Areas/User/Views/Invitations/Index.cshtml lists pending invites.
- [ ] wwwroot/js/Areas/User/Invitations/index.js performs accept/decline via API.
- [ ] UI updates and shows success/error.
- [ ] Where users are listed or displayed, show both username and display name for clarity.

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Add Razor view and JS module
- [ ] Wire to invitations API endpoints
- [ ] Add simple client-side validations
- [ ] Update spec/index.yml

## Verification
- dotnet run → /User/Invitations
- Accept/decline flows persist and reflect immediately

## Notes
Reuse alert helpers; ensure correct auth area routing.
