## Summary
Implement application services for group CRUD, membership lifecycle, and invitations, wiring auditing hooks and enforcing role/admin checks per design.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [x] Service methods cover create/update/delete group, list groups, add/remove member, invite/accept/decline.
- [x] Auditing calls fire on invite/accept/decline/leave/remove.
- [x] Unit tests cover positive/negative paths for permissions and state transitions.

## Steps
- [x] Read inputs
- [x] Add service interfaces/impls
- [x] Integrate auditing and validation rules
- [x] Add focused unit tests
- [x] Update spec/index.yml

## Verification
- dotnet build
- dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Groups|Invitations"

## Notes
Reuse existing patterns in Services/* and BaseController auditing signatures.
