## Summary
Implement application services for group CRUD, membership lifecycle, and invitations, wiring auditing hooks and enforcing role/admin checks per design.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Service methods cover create/update/delete group, list groups, add/remove member, invite/accept/decline.
- [ ] Auditing calls fire on invite/accept/decline/leave/remove.
- [ ] Unit tests cover positive/negative paths for permissions and state transitions.

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Add service interfaces/impls
- [ ] Integrate auditing and validation rules
- [ ] Add focused unit tests
- [ ] Update spec/index.yml

## Verification
- dotnet build
- dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Groups|Invitations"

## Notes
Reuse existing patterns in Services/* and BaseController auditing signatures.
