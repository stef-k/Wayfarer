## Summary
Build an integration test suite covering the full mobile groups flow (list, roster, latest/query locations, SSE auth + heartbeats) to guard against regressions before reusing the services in web controllers.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Integration tests simulate token-authenticated user executing list, members, latest, query endpoints with positive/negative cases.
- [ ] SSE integration test validates heartbeat frames and enriched payload arrival on live updates.
- [ ] Suite runs within acceptable time and is wired into `dotnet test` (CI-ready).

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Implement integration tests with in-memory data
- [ ] Run verification
- [ ] Update spec/index.yml (status, deps if changed)

## Verification
- `dotnet test --filter MobileIntegration`

## Notes
Reuse existing in-memory DbContext/test helpers; document any long-running tests or data seeding patterns.
