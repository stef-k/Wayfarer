# Trips

Overview
- A Trip contains Regions. Regions contain Places and Areas. Trips can also have Segments (routes) that connect Places.
- Trips are private by default; you can make them public to share.

Creating a Trip
1) Open Trips and click New.
2) Name your trip and save. You can toggle public/private at any time.

Regions and Places
