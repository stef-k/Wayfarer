# Exporting Data

Location Timeline Exports
- From the All Locations page, export your timeline to:
  - GeoJSON — includes reverse‑geocoded fields when available
  - CSV — flat table with rich address metadata and timestamps
  - GPX — track with Wayfarer extensions in `<extensions>` (address, activity, notes, etc.)
  - KML — placemarks with extended data

Trip Exports
- KML (Wayfarer flavor) — retains trip structure and colors for re‑import or viewing.
- KML (Google MyMaps) — compatible with Google MyMaps.
- PDF Guide — printable guide of your trip.

Notes
- Export filenames include the current date/time for convenience.
- Exports contain only your own data and respect your trip privacy settings.
